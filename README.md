# DHI | React Components

[![CI - lab](https://github.com/DHI-GRAS/react-components-ts/actions/workflows/main-lab.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/DHI-GRAS/react-components-ts/actions/workflows/main-lab.yml)

React components shared across DHI for implementing our Corporate Visual Identity and working together towards great UX and coherent design.


## Packages and their scope

We have two packages, similar to what you might know from [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/components/about-the-lab/):
1. [Lab package](packages/react-components-lab) for rapid uptake and incubation of new components to prove their use and quality.
1. [Core package](packages/react-components) for mature and widely used components. This package also contains larger components from SPOPX.


## Contributing

We welcome any components that implement an element of the [DHI Design Guidelines](https://www.figma.com/file/pSfX5GNsa6xhKGbi3DWQtn/DHI-Official-Guidelines) or are otherwise generic enough in 
functionality and close enough to the DHI CVI that they are likely to find reuse in other projects. Size does not matter, but the component should be beyond what you can achieve by theming, 
styling, or compositing existing components.

Please also check out the guidelines for the package you are contributing to.
